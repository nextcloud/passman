## Encryption (server side)
All passwords are encrypted client side AND server side.
This means that if you move to another server you have to backup the following from config.php
- `passwordsalt`
- `secret`

## Docker
To run passman with docker you can use `docker run  -p 8080:80 -p 8443:443 brantje/passman`
To use your own SSL cert mount them as below   
Example:   
`docker run -p 8080:80 -p 8443:443 -v /directory/cert.pem:/data/ssl/cert.pem -v /directory/cert.key:/data/ssl/cert.key brantje/passman`


## Development
Passman uses a single `.js` file for the templates. This gives the benefit that we don't need to request every template with XHR.   
For CSS we use SASS so you need ruby and sass installed.  
`templates.js` and the CSS are built with `grunt`.
To watch for changes use `grunt watch`
To run the unit tests install phpunit globally, and setup the environment variables on the `launch_phpunit.sh` script then just run that script, any arguments passed to this script will be forwarded to phpunit.

## FAQ
**Are you adding something to check if malicious code is executing on the browser?**   
No, because malicious code could edit the functions that check for malicious code.
